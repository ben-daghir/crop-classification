# CS4641-Final-Project

This repo contains the code for our CS4641 project. In this repo, we demonstrate usage of two different
machine learning techniques to classify crops in satellite images produced by the Sentinel-2. In
this repo, we use two methods for classification: multilayered perceptron and SVMs. To accomplish
this, we utilize Scikit learn for SVMs and Tensorflow for our neural network.
